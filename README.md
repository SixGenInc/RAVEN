# RAVEN

The Remote Access Vulnerability Exploitation Node (RAVEN), manufactured in partnership with Dell & FedData, is a combined hardware and software platform for cyber missions. Designed by cyber operations experts, the mobile centralized server is preconfigured with an attack, hunt and analytic platform. It offers full network auditing and is small and light enough to meet overhead bin size restrictions on all domestic flights. RAVEN supports various team sizes and can be customized with a suite of tools to support offensive and defensive missions. With ultimate power, flexibility, scalability and mobility in mind, RAVEN has been designed with removable drives to support use in classified environments. It provides the latest and greatest of the tools your cyber mission teams know and love in a powerful but portable package.
